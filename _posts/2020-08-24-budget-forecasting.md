## The Starting Line

For the last stretch as a student in the ranks of academia, our team was tasked to work with a third-party organization dedicated to the discovery of new and better ways to build financial wellness for users with high income volatility. The development included a team of multi-disciplinary engineers ranging from both web and mobile developers, as well as data scientists. As we approached the starting line, some concerns were already making themselves clear- communication between the involved parties would have to be responsive, and having access to proper data.

## The Challenge

-	Empower users to increase their savings and financial stability
-	Take minimal time and effort to use
-	Respond specifically to the needs and challenges of high income volatility and low-income users


## The Product

Our team still decided to hit the ground running, the first few weeks of the development cycle included pre-production in the form of wireframe prototyping, and making sure we had an idea of the architecture, and tools we would require. This allowed us to not only align on what we would require, but we also had an idea about the workload involved. Some of these decisions were also taken from an interest to learn new packages, to expand our ability to adopt new tools and adapt. 

## The Obstacles

Some of the challenges we faced revolved around two core issues- the lack of access to data other than a small sample, an amuse gueule of sorts, and friction within the curriculum of our program. The former casted doubt on whether to spend critical time to expand our components around the information we had, not knowing if the schema would change- usually a lot of work needs to be done if the data science tracks wants to develop a proper pipeline to bridge raw data sets, to points of contact between the other tracks. Cleaning has to be streamlined to also accept new information, graphs have to be robust enough to not break with the introduction of new variables, if the underlying data changes somewhere along the lines, then the probability of having to rebuild entire components is definitely up there.

The current state of our product includes a responsive application prototype. We have had a lot of ideas about what components of features we should implement. The team so far has never lacked interesting ideas, and sometimes we must bring ourselves back to the reality of the challenges we face, and the deliverables we must meet within a deadline.

## The Unknown

In conclusion, the future sure holds its secret close, some core curriculum changes are being made as we speak which casts uncertainty on our future endeavors. This post will be redacted in the future to see what challenges we’ll face, and what obstacles we’ll surmount.
