## The Starting Line

For the last stretch as a student, we were paired with a non-profit organization that strives to inform, inspire, and reward individuals who need help saving money. Through engaging technologies and partnerships, they give the working people the methods and motivation to take control of their financial futures.

## Budget Forecasting

As we lay the first bricks to our foundation, we made sure that the different tracks involved had a clear idea of the final product, making sure that we spent additional time during the pre-production process so that the development could proceed without much interruption. We designed both application wireframes, and established database schemas so the back-end could communicate effectively.

Having gone through the first few weeks of the project, we unfortunately encountered complications that slowed the progress of the Data-Science track- lack of user data. We decided to solve parts of this problem by generating some data that would immediately distribute the distribution and essence of the few data points that we already had. This led to further complications along the way as we ultimately had little idea how the overall customer database would look like.
